# CLAUDE.md

Last Updated: 2026-03-10

## Project Overview

**claude-config** — Personal Claude Code configuration repo containing custom skills, subagents, and workflow documentation.

- **Repo:** [burak-maxitech/claude-config](https://github.com/burak-maxitech/claude-config) (private)
- **README.md** — Public overview, setup instructions, command reference
- **Workflow.md** — Detailed personal workflow guide (daily workflow, scenarios, tips)
- **docs/** — Reference files (session history, key decisions, completed work)

## Current Status

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Skills (5) | Complete |
| Subagents (3) | Complete |
| Mac/Linux setup | Complete |
| Windows setup | Complete |
| GitHub sync | Complete |
| Documentation | Complete |

## Completed

All 5 skills, 3 subagents, cross-platform setup, and documentation system are complete.

See [docs/completed-work.md](docs/completed-work.md) for full checklist.

## In Progress

Nothing currently in progress.

## Next Steps

1. Add more skills as new workflow needs emerge
2. Improve existing skill reference files based on usage patterns
3. Consider adding hooks for automated pre-commit workflows
4. Explore MCP server integration for external tool access

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Symlink subdirectories, not entire ~/.claude | Preserves local credentials and config |
| Skills format (SKILL.md + references/) | Bundles logic with docs; YAML frontmatter for permissions |
| Subagents on Sonnet | Cost efficiency for scanning work |
| Parallel scanning in /code-cleanup | 3 simultaneous subagents for speed |
| Lean CLAUDE.md with reference file overflow | Keep under ~17k chars; details in docs/*.md |
| Three-file doc structure | README (public), CLAUDE.md (AI context), docs/ (references) |
| Auto-memory sync via /update-docs | Stable facts persist across sessions |
| Task hydration via TaskCreate | Live task tracking from CLAUDE.md content |
| Plan Mode in /plan-feature | Formal approval before coding begins |
| Session archiving (>3 sessions) | Auto-archive to docs/session-history.md |

```

**Symlink approach:** Only `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` are symlinked into `~/.claude/` on each machine. This preserves local credentials and settings while sharing skills and agents across machines via Git.

**Skills** are directories containing `SKILL.md` (main logic with YAML frontmatter) and a `references/` folder with supporting documents. They are user-invocable via `/skill-name`.

**Subagents** are markdown files in `.claude/agents/` dispatched by skills (not user-invocable). They run on Sonnet for cost efficiency and have scoped tool permissions.

## Known Issues / Blockers

None currently.

## Environment Variables

None required. This is a pure configuration repo — no runtime dependencies or secrets.

## Session History

> Full history: [docs/session-history.md](docs/session-history.md)

### Last Session (Session 1) - 2026-03-10
- Created CLAUDE.md with all 10 required sections
- Created docs/ folder with session-history.md, key-decisions.md, completed-work.md
- Added Documentation section to README.md with links
- No content removed from existing files
- Mode: REFACTOR (split monolithic docs into three-file structure)
