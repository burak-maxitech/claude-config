**`/seo-review` hardened across 4 improvement groups + 15 code-review fixes (S35, 2026-05-26).** Same-day continuation of S34 burakarik.com dogfood. User ran the skill with new `known-bad-urls.txt`; orchestrator wrote a 396-line `_inspect_batch.py` into `.seo-data/gsc/` (third disk-write boundary violation across S31 cont.² + S34 + S35) + only inspected 50 of 100 pasted URLs. Shipped 4 groups + ran `/code-review` extra-high effort surfacing 15 findings, then fixed all 15 same-session (+1105/-71 LOC across 7 files, uncommitted). **Group A:** new `inspect-batch` helper subcommand (parallel HTTP via ThreadPoolExecutor + per-URL cache + atomic write + 429/5xx retry); broader disk-write boundary rule forbidding ALL orchestrator-written scripts under `.seo-data/gsc/`. **Group B:** subagent-skip rule codified (new Step 4.5) with 4 gating conditions + audit-trail marking + `--force-dispatch` escape hatch. **Group C:** cache TTL split — sa-* stays 24h, ui-* becomes 7d (coverageState is weeks-stable; fixes the 0/197 cache-hit problem from S34). **Group D:** finding lifecycle infrastructure — `finding-history.json` (run_count tracker with same-commit guard + ESCALATE marker at run_count>=3) + `watchpoints.json` (auto-emitted on `code_changed_since_gsc_window=true` + 21-day recheck + 90-day evict). Three new helper subcommands. **Top correctness fixes:** `head -1 sa-q2-*.json` race → deterministic hash recomputation; DST off-by-one via `time.mktime` → `datetime.date.fromisoformat()`; null-metric TypeError; operator precedence in `classify_transition`; bare `.tmp` race → PID suffix; 20-worker rate-limit burst → 6 workers + retries.

## In Progress

None — S35 is committed (`548bdee`) and the working tree is clean. Next session picks up the validation/dogfood backlog from Next Steps (now #1: validate S35 `/seo-review` on a real burakarik.com run).

## Next Steps

1. **Validate S35 on a real burakarik.com run.** Infrastructure now backs the S34 validation step: 100 user-supplied URL cap (was 50), helper-driven Turn 2b dispatch, split TTL (ui-* 7d means S34 cache entries now hit), finding-history infrastructure ready to track all current findings as run_count=1. Sub-dim 14 will fire since S34 wrote the baseline snapshot. Skip-mode (`dispatch_mode == "skip_codebase_subagents"`) likely fires on subsequent same-property reruns if no code commits intervene.
2. **Dogfood `/test-review` on a real Node/Jest or Python/pytest project** — built S24 but never invoked end-to-end. Watch for: T01 false-positive rate (project-defined assertion-helper scan should be the gate), twin-headline math correctness on real subagent output, `--coverage` opt-in path against an actual jest `coverage-summary.json` / pytest `coverage.json`, scan-economics ratio thresholds (>3.0 over, <0.1 under), non-overlap with `/code-cleanup`. S30 + S34 + S35 dogfood patterns validate value here.
3. **Dogfood `/architecture-review` on a non-trivial real project** — never run end-to-end yet. Watch for linter-detection accuracy, intended-architecture summary quality, CCN-delta filter behavior, simplification false-positive rate. **S30/S34/S35 lesson:** look for similar under-specifications in budget utilization, disk-cache boundaries, parser tool assumptions, blind-spot sampling — the patterns that surfaced in `/seo-review` likely have analogs in any data-ingestion-heavy skill.
4. **Dogfood `/code-health-advice`** — built S22 but never invoked end-to-end. Watch for: bucket misclassification rate, freshness-mismatch detection accuracy, cases where a 6th bucket would help.
5. **Address /seo-review deferred refactors** (captured in /simplify passes S25 + S27 + S29; S34/S35 didn't add new ones — all dogfood-surfaced concerns shipped same-session): batched-Grep alternation across scan-technical/content/geo (biggest runtime win — 30 Greps → 3-6 per scan on real projects); fix-mode harness extraction from architecture-review/references/fix-mode.md; plan-mode scaffolding extraction across the 3 plan-mode-*.md files; cross-file boilerplate consolidation into a shared-rules ref file (~25-40 lines saveable). Best done after further dogfood surfaces which refactor is most needed.
6. Improve existing skill reference files based on usage patterns.
7. Consider adding hooks for automated pre-commit workflows.
8. Explore MCP server integration for external tool access.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|

| `/seo-review` GSC API response cache — 24h TTL + `--no-cache` bypass flag (S31) | Motivated by the user's hesitation to consume GSC API quota during iterative `burakarik6` dogfood ("very precious to not consume usage limits of the API"). Wraps `searchanalytics.query` (Q1/Q2/Q3, 3 calls/run) + `urlInspection.index.inspect` (up to 100 calls/run, against the strict 2,000/day quota). Auth probe (sites.list) deliberately NOT cached — it's the live mode-detection check, must stay live. **TTL = 24h**, settled via brief design discussion: matches GSC's own ~2-day finalization lag. **`--no-cache` flag** forces fresh refetch but still writes responses to cache for next run. **Cache layout:** `.seo-data/gsc/cache/<prefix>-<sha1-hash>.json`. Per-Q-call prefixes (`sa-q1`/`sa-q2`/`sa-q3`) + per-URL prefix (`ui-`). **Wrapper invariants (5):** atomic write via `$CACHE_FILE.tmp.$$` + `mv` on HTTP 200; never cache non-200; TTL check via `find -mmin -$TTL_MIN`; cache dir pre-created in Step 1.6.1; first-stdout-line status marker. **Eviction:** `find -mtime +7 -delete` at Turn 1. **Disk-write boundary updated** to add `cache/` as a 3rd allowed entry under `.seo-data/gsc/`. **S35 update:** TTL split by call-type — sa-* stays 24h, ui-* becomes 7d (coverageState is weeks-stable). |

| `/seo-review` — 6 spec gaps codified from burakarik6 dogfood (S31 cont.²) | 4th `/seo-review` run of the day on burakarik.com surfaced 6 distinct issues + 1 design problem the orchestrator improvised around at runtime. Categorized 2 critical bugs / 2 spec ambiguities / 1 design issue / 1 emergent capability. All 6 fixes shipped same-session in commit `7109213` (5 files / +474 / -18 LOC). **Fix #1 — UTF-8 enforcement on Python**: Windows charmap default crashes on Turkish + GSC prompt-injection queries; codify `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 PYTHONUTF8=1` env vars on every invocation + `encoding='utf-8'` on every `open()`. **Fix #2 — Same-commit history dedup**: score swung 60→48→40→55 across 4 runs with last commit being docs-only (methodology variance, not codebase change); embed `<!-- commit:abc1234 -->` HTML comment + skip append when commit_sha already has an entry. **Fix #3 — Ship `references/gsc-parse-helper.py`** (~250 lines, 6 subcommands `q1`/`q2`/`q3`/`ctr`/`clusters`/`brand`): retires inline Python heredocs; helper script is the canonical parser. **Fix #4 — New sub-dim 13 `brand_query_anomaly`** (catalog now 12→13): codifies emergent capability — orchestrator caught `"burak arık"` at pos 7.91 / 1.93% CTR as entity-recognition deficit. **Fix #5 — CTR opportunity dual trigger**: high-volume override (imp>=10000 AND ctr<0.5% regardless of position). **Fix #6 — Probe-skipped redistribution rendering** mandatory in report footer. |

| Renamed custom `/code-review` → `/review-deep` after Anthropic naming collision (S32) | On 2026-05-23 Anthropic renamed built-in `/simplify` → `/code-review`, colliding with the custom code-review skill in this repo. The two skills are genuinely different — built-in is a lightweight diff scan with effort levels + `--comment` PR-comment posting; custom is a senior-engineer review with codebase-convention scanning + `--security` (OWASP) / `--verify` (run tests/lint, parallel-backgrounded since S19) / `--fix` / `--last-commit` modes. Solution: rename the custom skill to `/review-deep` and position the review tooling as a **3-tier ladder**: `/code-review` (built-in, fast, daily driver) → `/review-deep` (custom, thorough) → `/ultrareview` (built-in, cloud, 5+ verifying agents, high-risk pre-merge). Scope expanded to also updating `/simplify` references throughout operational docs to `/code-review` (since `/simplify` no longer exists by that name). 16 operational files modified + 1 directory rename via `git mv`; historical files deliberately left untouched as records of past state. README "Three review tiers" blockquote restructured to lead with the rename context + 2026-05-23 date. |

| 5 best-practice improvements from 2026 Claude Code docs audit (S33) | Web research across official Anthropic docs + 2026 community guides surfaced 5 high-leverage improvements, all implemented same-session in commit `5a441d1`: **(1) `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` substitution** in `/seo-review` for `gsc-parse-helper.py` invocations (CWD-independent + cross-platform). **(2) `effort: high` audit + `ultrathink` injection** — added `effort: high` to `/code-cleanup`; deliberate `effort: low` retained on `/code-health-advice`, `/resume-work`, `/update-docs` (routing/IO-bound). Added `ultrathink` keyword to the three `--plan` mode reference files. **(3) `description:` / `when_to_use:` split** on 4 verbose skills. Guards against silent description-truncation. **(4) Dynamic `` !`<cmd>` `` injection** in `/code-health-advice` Step 1 + `/resume-work` Step 2. Saves 1 turn per invocation. **(5) SessionStart hook bundle** — `session-start-context.sh` + `.ps1` in `.claude/scripts/`. Eliminates manual `/resume-work` for routine session starts. |

| `/seo-review` S34 extension — sub-dim 14 `deindex_regression` + 200/run URL Inspection + 4-slice URL selection + known-bad-urls.txt (2026-05-26) | Triggered by user's burakarik.com indexed-page decline + two GSC validation-failed emails (838 "Page with redirect" + 663 "Not found (404)" URLs sharing `/article/*` + `/en/article/*` + `/tr/article/*` locale-collision pattern). Existing skill's impressions-only sampling was blind to URLs Google had deindexed (they fall out of `url_impressions_map` → never inspected → user only learns when Google emails). 5-area extension across 10 files (+662/-67): **(1) URL Inspection 100/run → 200/run**, new sitemap-orphan slice (document-order sort — deterministic for snapshot regression diff). **(2) Sub-dim 14 `deindex_regression`** — orchestrator-emitted from snapshot diff at `.seo-data/gsc/snapshots/<ts>-<sha>.json` (30-day rotation, path-cluster + git-correlation evidence). **(3) Sub-dim 5 severity tiering** medium/<50, high/≥50 + locale-prefix-cluster detection. **(4) Sub-dim 4 ↔ sub-dim 5 cross-link** via `co_occurrence_with_sub_dim_5` evidence (the "single i18n migration root cause, two symptoms" diagnosis); git-changed slice now resolves BOTH `old_path` AND `new_path` from rename commits. **(5) `.seo-data/gsc/known-bad-urls.txt`** as 4th user-supplied URL source (S35 raised cap 50→100/run). `score_impact:0` invariant maintained on all GSC findings. **Burakarik.com's indexing decline is a codebase-level issue** (incomplete i18n canonical migration around ~4/21/26 inflection) — NOT caused by anything Claude has done. |

| `/seo-review` S35 hardening — 4 improvement groups + 15 code-review fixes (2026-05-26) | Same-day continuation of S34 dogfood. User ran the skill on burakarik6 with the new `known-bad-urls.txt`; orchestrator wrote a 396-line `_inspect_batch.py` into `.seo-data/gsc/` (3rd disk-write boundary violation across S31 cont.² + S34 + S35) + only inspected 50 of 100 pasted URLs. Shipped 4 groups + ran `/code-review` extra-high surfacing 15 findings + fixed all 15 same-session (+1105/-71 LOC across 7 files, uncommitted). **Group A:** new `inspect-batch` helper subcommand (~200 LOC: ThreadPoolExecutor parallel HTTP + per-URL 7d ui-* TTL + atomic write via `.tmp.<pid>` + os.replace + never-cache-non-200 + 3-retry exponential backoff on 429/5xx + 6 workers). Broader disk-write boundary rule: NO orchestrator-written Python/JS/shell anywhere under `.seo-data/gsc/`. Canonical-paths table forbids the next improvisation by name. **Group B:** subagent-skip rule codified (new Step 4.5) with 4 gating conditions + audit-trail marker `(inherited from <sha> [<date>])` + `inherited_from:<sha>` HTML comment on history rows + new `--force-dispatch` escape hatch. **Group C:** cache TTL split — sa-* stays 24h, ui-* becomes 7d after S34 scored 0/197 cache hits despite 85 prior cache entries (3 days old, past 24h TTL). Two-tier eviction (sa- at 7d, ui- at 14d = TTL + slack). **Group D:** finding lifecycle = `finding-history.json` (run_count tracker with same-commit guard so methodology-variance reruns don't inflate, `ESCALATE` at run_count>=3) + `watchpoints.json` (auto-emitted on `code_changed_since_gsc_window=true`, 21-day recheck, 90-day evict). Three new helper subcommands: `history-update`, `watchpoint-emit`, `watchpoint-check` (4 banner formats: improved/regressed/unchanged/no_data). **15 code-review fixes — top correctness bugs:** `head -1 sa-q2-*.json` picked random old Q2 file → deterministic hash recomputation from cache-key inputs; `time.mktime`/`localtime` had DST off-by-one on UTC dates → `datetime.date.fromisoformat() + timedelta()`; `_watchpoint_status` crashed on None metrics → filter upstream; "3-slice" docs-spec drift across 5 files → bulk to "4-slice"; operator precedence in `classify_transition` for `'soft 404 (not found)'` → parens; bare `.tmp` race → PID suffix; 20-worker burst rate → 6 + retries; `sys.exit(1)` before stdout flush → return bool + print-before-write; missing `\|\| skip` error trap between Step 6.8 sub-steps; null-title TypeError → `(f.get('title') or '')`; dangling "Pre-Turn-2 watchpoint check" reference → Step 1.6.14; per-call CACHE_STATUS spec drift → split Turn 2a (per-call) vs Turn 2b (aggregate); 24h-TTL back-references in 3 places; `_atomic_write_json` duplicated `snapshot_write` → refactored. **Altitude lesson:** every new dispatch shape that lives in spec-prose-only ("N parallel bash curl calls") gets improvised by the orchestrator into `.seo-data/gsc/` until shipped as a canonical helper subcommand. Same pattern as S30 `jq`-missing + S31 cont.² UTF-8-on-Windows. The fix is always "ship the canonical primitive," not "tell the orchestrator harder." |

```

**Symlink approach:** Only `.claude/skills/` and `.claude/agents/` are symlinked into `~/.claude/` on each machine. This preserves local credentials and settings while sharing skills and agents across machines via Git.

**Skills** are directories containing `SKILL.md` (main logic with YAML frontmatter) and a `references/` folder with supporting documents. They are user-invocable via `/skill-name`.

**Subagents** are markdown files in `.claude/agents/` dispatched by skills (not user-invocable). They run on Sonnet for cost efficiency and have scoped tool permissions.

## Known Issues / Blockers

None currently.

## Environment Variables

None required. This is a pure configuration repo — no runtime dependencies or secrets.

## Session History

> Full history: [docs/session-history.md](docs/session-history.md)

### Last Session (Session 36) - 2026-05-28
- **Doc-housekeeping session — no code work.** Ran `/resume-work` then `/update-docs`. The resume scan caught that CLAUDE.md was stale on its own post-commit state.
- **Reconciled S35 commit state.** CLAUDE.md claimed S35 was "complete and uncommitted" with Next Step #1 = "commit S35" — but S35 *was* committed as `548bdee` (the S35 close-out doc run ran just before the commit). Corrected `## In Progress` → None, dropped the done Next Step #1, renumbered the rest (now 8 items).
- **Auto-memory drift fixed (Part 4).** `MEMORY.md` listed 7 skills / 7 subagents (naming the pre-rename `code-review`, missing the SEO/test skills + agents). Resynced to 9 skills / 13 subagents + added the SessionStart scripts.
- **Part 5 rollup fired:** adding this S36 entry pushed S32 (the `/review-deep` rename) out of the 5-most-recent window → compressed to a one-liner with commit `e38951a`. No new Key Decision; CLAUDE.md at ~21k (Parts 6/7 skip).
- **Context:** 4 marketplace plugins installed locally this session (superpowers, code-simplifier, playwright, claude-code-setup) — local `~/.claude` only, not committed to this repo.
